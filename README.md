# ManiaVersionSelector
Utility that allows the selection of an installed TrackMania/ManiaPlanet instance when opening a `.Gbx` file

## Todo list
- [ ] Icon, so that `.Gbx` files don't have the generic executable icon
- [ ] Configuration UI instead of manual `configuration.json` editing
- [ ] Support for commandline arguments for the launched applications
- [ ] Installer
- [ ] Automatic detection of appropriate game version?
